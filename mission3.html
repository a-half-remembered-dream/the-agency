        <p>Nice job, agent. Your work is, as always, very helpful to the agency.</p>
        <p class="my-3">In these few days the agency has jumped on your lead to catch McCormick. It turns out that we were just a day late, and when we shut down the bar and
        searched the place, he was already long gone. This might be a setback, but we can't lose hope. We found some good evidence that he left behind, evidence that <i>you</i> can investigate. I know you like to get out into the field, but for right now you will be our forensics consultant.</p>
        <p class="my-3">This is a photo we found in his office at the bar:</p>
        <a href="images/vacation.JPG"><img src="images/vacation.JPG" style="max-width: 100%;"></img></a>
        <p class="my-3">We think it is a vacation photo he took a year ago. It's not much, but it could be our next big lead. We need you find out where that is. Our geographical division thinks it's somewhere in Europe, maybe in the north-west, near Luxembourg.</p>
        <p class="my-3">This is a hard one, but we have faith in you. Even if you can't make progress, keep us updated on whatever you can get out of this.</p>
        <p class="my-5">MESSAGE END</p>
